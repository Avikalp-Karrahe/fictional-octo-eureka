## Deploying on Railway

### Method 1: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
3. Sign up/login and click "New Project"
4. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Choose your repository
6. Add environment variables:
   - Go to your project â†’ Variables
   - Add `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `INTRO_CHANNEL_ID`, and `OUTER_CIRCLE_ROLE_ID`
7. Railway will automatically deploy using the `Procfile`

### Method 2: Railway CLI

1. Install Railway CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```
2. Login to Railway:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```
3. Initialize project:
   ```bash
   railway init
   ```
4. Add environment variables:
   ```bash
   railway variables set DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
   railway variables set INTRO_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
   railway variables set OUTER_CIRCLE_ROLE_ID=your_role_id_here
   ```
5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

## How It Works

1. **New Member Joins**: They can only see `#rules` and `#intro` channels
2. **First Message**: When they post in `#intro`, the bot:
   - Checks if they already have "Outer Circle" role
   - If not, assigns the role
   - Replies with a warm, randomized welcome message
3. **Access Granted**: They can now see all channels available to "Outer Circle" members

## Welcome Messages

The bot randomly selects from these warm, human-like messages:

- "Hey {user}, glad you're here ðŸŒŸ. Take your time exploring â€” you're now part of the Outer Circle."
- "Welcome aboard, {user} âœ¨! We've been saving you a seat."
- "It's so good to meet you, {user} ðŸŒ¸. You've unlocked the Outer Circle â€” can't wait to see you around."
- "{user}, your journey starts here ðŸš€. The Outer Circle is wide open for you now."
- "Warmest welcome, {user} ðŸ’«. You're among friends."
- And 5 more variations!

## Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Responding
- âœ… Check that the bot is online in your server
- âœ… Verify `INTRO_CHANNEL_ID` matches your intro channel
- âœ… Ensure the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the intro channel

### Role Not Being Assigned
- âœ… Check that `OUTER_CIRCLE_ROLE_ID` is correct
- âœ… Ensure the bot's role is higher than "Outer Circle" in the role hierarchy
- âœ… Verify the bot has "Manage Roles" permission

### Bot Crashes on Startup
- âœ… Verify your `DISCORD_TOKEN` is correct
- âœ… Check that all required intents are enabled
- âœ… Ensure Node.js version is 16.9.0 or higher
